## Project Overview
This project leverages Power BI to analyze manufacturing data, ensuring data quality and providing actionable insights to improve decision-making in manufacturing operations. The analysis focuses on key metrics such as production costs, employee performance, and regional operations.

## Part 1: Data Cleaning, Modeling, and DAX

In this phase, the following tasks were performed:

1. **Data Import and Exploration**  
   Imported datasets and conducted an initial review to identify any missing data, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Cleaned the data by removing irrelevant entries and fixing data type issues to ensure accurate analysis.

3. **Merging and Relating Datasets**  
   Merged datasets using a common key to ensure a cohesive analysis of production, employee, and performance data.

4. **Data Modeling and DAX**  
   Created new columns and measures to enhance data analysis, including calculating production costs, employee performance metrics, and product trends using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).

## Part 2: Dashboard Creation

The second part of the project involved building an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes key insights from the data analysis.

The dashboard includes the following key visualizations:
- **Production Costs Analysis**
- **Employee Performance Metrics**
- **Regional Sales and Production Insights**
- **Product Lifecycle and Trends**
- **Cost Efficiency Comparisons**

## Key Insights
- **Product Cost Analysis**: Identified high production cost areas and suggested optimization strategies.
- **Employee Distribution**: Visualized employee distribution by departments and regions, helping identify key performance areas.
- **Sales and Production Correlation**: Analyzed trends between production volume and sales performance, uncovering seasonal patterns.
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Performed forecasting to predict future production costs and demand.

## Conclusion
This Power BI project demonstrates the power of data-driven insights to improve manufacturing operations. The project highlights the importance of data cleaning, advanced modeling using DAX, and interactive dashboards in driving better business decisions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used for creating custom measures and performing complex calculations.
- **Excel**: Used for initial data structuring.
